# MilkVRLauncher
A simple Andoid App that grabs a link and sends it to MilkVR.


FAQ:

> Emby app does not show MilkVRLauncher. Only VLC and MX-Player :(

-> The Video is not an .mp4. Pls. remux/convert to .mp4
-> Othere people also having this problem. Instead of the Emby app you can use [bubbleupnp](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bubblesoft.android.bubbleupnp)

> The video plays, but there is no Sound :(

-> Android only supports MP3, AAC, WMA, WAV, AC3 Audio

>The screen stays black :(

-> Is it realy a mp4 or did you only rename the video? Android  should support MPEG4, H.264, VC-1, DivX/XviD, H.263, Sorenson H.263. I am not shure what MilkVR realy supports.

> MilkVRLauncher crashes when I try to create a link

-> Is there a "milkVR" folder on the root of your internal storrage? No? Pls. create one. The app needs this folder to create the link-files :)

-> MilkVR has to be installed. If you can't find it in oculus store use VPN like Hola to download MilkVR.

> I have got a NAS and emby.media is not available. But my NAS has a DLNA Server, can I use that?

-> Some people did use [bubbleupnp](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bubblesoft.android.bubbleupnp) to browse through DLNA content.

> I did try to open a video with ESFileExplorer from a network share. But the screen stays black.

-> Have a look into this thread: [MilkVR streams from SMB (ES File Explorer)](https://redd.it/3wu6zg)
